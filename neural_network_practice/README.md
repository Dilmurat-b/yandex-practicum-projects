# Computer vision: the practice of training neural networks
These tasks were carried out as part of taking the Computer Vision module, as neural network training practice.  

Training neural networks on a central processor takes a lot of time, especially if the neural network is trained to solve computer vision problems. Therefore, for training models, graphics processors are used, which significantly speed up the process.

A special simulator is used to train computer vision models. All computations will be performed on a server with a graphics card (GPU) [Yandex Compute Cloud](https://yandex.cloud/ru/services/compute?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpracticum.yandex.ru%2F).

Here are 5 tasks for training models on servers with GPU.

1. Full-layer neural networks:
  * training a multi-layer neural network;
2. Convolutional neural networks:
  * Adam optimization algorithm;
  * convolutional networks for fruit classification;
  * ResNET in Keras
3. Individual project ([age_detection]):
  * model training
