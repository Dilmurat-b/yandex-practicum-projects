# Big Cities Music

The comparison between Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths. For example:

  * Moscow is a metropolis, subject to the rigid rhythm of the working week;
  * St. Petersburg is a cultural capital with its own tastes.

Using Yandex Music data, it is necessary to compare the behavior of users in two capitals.

## Objective of the research

Test three hypotheses:

1. User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways.
2. On Monday morning in Moscow, some genres prevail, and in St. Petersburg, others. Likewise, on Friday evenings, different genres predominate, depending on the city.
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow people listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg they listen to Russian rap.

## Project progress

Nothing is known about the quality of the data. Therefore, a review of the data will be required before testing the hypothesis. It is necessary to check the data for errors and evaluate their impact on the study. Then, at the preprocessing stage, find an opportunity to correct the most critical errors in the data.

Thus, the research will take place in three stages:

1. Data overview.
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Hypotheses testing.
