# Research of Borrowers' Reliability

The customer is the credit department of a bank. We need to understand whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affects the fact of repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of clients.

The results of the research will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to the bank.

## Objective of the research

Analyze the factors affecting the solvency of the bank client. To help identify potential borrowers who are unreliable.

## Project progress

Nothing is known about the quality of the data. It is necessary to check the data for errors and evaluate their impact on the study. Then, at the preprocessing stage, find an opportunity to correct the most critical errors in the data.

Thus, the research will take place in three stages:

1. Data overview.
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Exploratory data analysis.
